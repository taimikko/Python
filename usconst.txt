In fact, because those actions require legislation
passed by Congress which must be signed by the President
to take effect, those powers are not strictly executive powers
granted to or retained by Congress per se. Nor were they retained by
the U.S. Congress as leftovers from the Articles of Confederation. The
Articles of Confederation, Continental Congress and its powers were
abolished at the time the new U.S. Congress was seated and the new
federal government formally and officially replaced its interim
predecessor. And although the President is not specifically granted the
power to declare war, a declaration of war is not in and of itself a
vehicle of executive power since it is literally just a public
declaration that the U.S. government considers itself "at war" with a
foreign political entity.
