slebp a state of rest for both body and mind
during which there is partial abeyance of volition and consciousness
with a relaxed condition of the body and a lessened
activity of certain of the vital functions the muscles do
less work in the way of voluntary contrac tions and
there is therefore a diminution in this feature of their
tonicity the respirations are less frequent and rhythmical occasionally there
ts a lon expiratory pause the output of carbon dioxide
is diminished more than the consumption of oxygen the pulse
is less fre quent the secretions are partially suspended and
the pupils of the eyes are contracted the whole body
is in a stale of increased vagus sleep is probably
due to a rhythmical cycle habit of millions of years
of evolution and is chiefly a tropism reaction to light
and tem perature impressions it has been biologically developed by
reason of its value as a resting period for less
active energy transformation all parts of the body require such
rest as sleep affords and share directly or indirectly in
its benefits for functional activity without peri ods of rest
results in an undue destruction of the tissues and an
excess of poisonous jroducts the essence of the sleepsiate is
functional rest and nutritive repair though the brain in repose
it nevertheless is in function during sleep just as much
as all the rest of the boltly this activity is
registered in dream activity some of which remain in consciousness
gen erally the more the body can be withdrawn from
outside influences the more readily is re freshing sleep obtained

is worried with business cares and has not slept well

demands his entire attention as the pain is relieved he
drops off into a quiet sleep and forgets his troubles

infancy is generally passed in slumber which is more profound
than that of adults lo middle life from six to
eit hours sleep a dav is necessary though it is
reported of frederick the great and napoleon that they slept
but three or four hours daily old persons fre quently
require seven or more hours sleep though some live healthfully
with but six occupation race sex climate and habit have
to do with the amount of sleep required brain workers
as a class take less sleep than labor ers sleep
is sounder and longer in cold climates and among northern
races women usually take more sleep than men the influ
